# Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) fork for university assignment

This project is a fork of the main ARC task data https://github.com/fchollet/ARC, normally used for testing both humans and artificial intelligence approaches with a wide variety of pattern detection problems.
However, for this assignment, the existing files and directories are unmodified (for an explanation of them please see the master repository's Readme instead), and only the Src directory is new.

In this assignment, the task was to create hard-coded solutions for multiple of the existing tasks, in data/training. In this case, it's creating solutions for:
46442a0e.json
a61ba2ce.json
4be741c5.json
67e8384a.json
The code for these solutions is entirely contained in the Src directory.
